NOTES GROUP 1: -----------------------------------V
TopAcc
-limited by distance to mouse
-limited by strength (increased with higher strength)

TopSpeed
- decreased by strength

1: setMagnitude of Speed based on strength (higher strength = lower magnitude/more control)

basically, high strength means high speed
low strength means more spray

power = strength - weaponweight
if power < 0
power = 1
starting speed is decreased in magnitude with power (but at a level lower than the increase of top acceleration and topspeed
TopAcc is increased with power 
topSpeed is increased with power
both topspeed and topacc are decreased by distance to mouse


NOTES GROUP 2: -----------------------------------V
The aim is such that the strength-weight controls the speed at which the player can swing the weapon
There are two routes this can take:
1: Power = strength(* balancing) - weight(* balancing) + (balancing2)	#where balancing represents game balancing, a starting power of some sort
	EX: 
	- if a player with strength 10 picks up a weapon at weight 5, he can swing at the same speed as a player of strength 150 and a weapon of weight 145
	PROS:
	- everytime a player increases in strength, the speed at which they can swing a weapon increases. Leveling up strength is meaningful
	CONS:
	- Players with higher strength literally have more speed. A player with strength 150  can swing a weapon of weight 100 faster than a player of strength 10 could swing a weapon of weight 1
2: Power = strength / weight * (balancing)
	EX: A player of strength 10 can swing a weapon of weight 5 at the same speed a player of strength 100 can swing a weapon of weight 50
	PROS:
	- speed balancing. All players have the same potential top speed and bottom speed (give or take a few decimal points)
	- leveling up strength does increase the maximum weight of a weapon that one can carry
	CONS:
	-leveling up strength is less meaningful. An increase of strength from 100 to 101 has no noticeable impact on speed of swing
	- 

top speed: 25% strength or less
medium: 26%- 70&
slow: 71% or greater

power = 10: 10/10 maxed out strength. 	1 = 10		10
power = 15: 8/10 heavy weapon.   		1.25 = 15	12
power = 20: 7/10 very low				1.43		13
power = 25: 6/10						1.66		15
power = 35: 4-5/10 light weapon			2.5			17.5
power = 60: 3/10 instantaneous			3.3			20
power = 100 1/10						10			10
